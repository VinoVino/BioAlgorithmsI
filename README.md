# BioAlgorithmsI
## Coursera BioAlgorithms class - Coding Track
### This class served as my first introduction to Python. 
The class is now broken into three separate classes on Coursera.

* Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)
* Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)
* Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III)
